# Alright, let's go through this line-by-line and explain each iteration in detail.

# Weâ€™ll use the given `board` and show what happens at each step, focusing on one 3x3 sub-grid at a time.

# ---

# ### Initial Setup
# Here's the board again for reference:

# ```python
# board = [
#     ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
#     ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
#     [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
#     ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
#     ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
#     ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
#     [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
#     [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
#     [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
# ]
# ```

# And here are the starting positions of each 3x3 sub-grid:

# ```python
# starts = [
#     (0,0), (0,3), (0,6),
#     (3,0), (3,3), (3,6),
#     (6,0), (6,3), (6,6),
# ]
# ```

# ### Code Explanation with Iteration Details

# Let's go through each 3x3 sub-grid defined by `starts` and see what happens.

# ---

# #### **First 3x3 Sub-Grid (Top-Left Corner)**

# - **Starting Point**: `(0,0)`

# The grid cells for this sub-grid are as follows:

# ```plaintext
# 5 3 .
# 6 . .
# . 9 8
# ```

# - **Execution Steps**:

# 1. **Initialize `s = set()`** to keep track of numbers encountered in this sub-grid.

# 2. **Row 0**:
#    - Column 0: `item = board[0][0] = "5"`
#      - `"5"` is not in `s`, so add `"5"` to `s`.
#    - Column 1: `item = board[0][1] = "3"`
#      - `"3"` is not in `s`, so add `"3"` to `s`.
#    - Column 2: `item = board[0][2] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# 3. **Row 1**:
#    - Column 0: `item = board[1][0] = "6"`
#      - `"6"` is not in `s`, so add `"6"` to `s`.
#    - Column 1: `item = board[1][1] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 2: `item = board[1][2] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# 4. **Row 2**:
#    - Column 0: `item = board[2][0] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 1: `item = board[2][1] = "9"`
#      - `"9"` is not in `s`, so add `"9"` to `s`.
#    - Column 2: `item = board[2][2] = "8"`
#      - `"8"` is not in `s`, so add `"8"` to `s`.

# - **End of First Sub-Grid Check**:
#   - All items are unique, so move to the next 3x3 sub-grid.

# ---

# #### **Second 3x3 Sub-Grid (Top-Center)**

# - **Starting Point**: `(0,3)`

# The grid cells for this sub-grid are as follows:

# ```plaintext
# . 7 .
# 1 9 5
# . . .
# ```

# - **Execution Steps**:

# 1. **Initialize `s = set()`**.

# 2. **Row 0**:
#    - Column 3: `item = board[0][3] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 4: `item = board[0][4] = "7"`
#      - `"7"` is not in `s`, so add `"7"` to `s`.
#    - Column 5: `item = board[0][5] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# 3. **Row 1**:
#    - Column 3: `item = board[1][3] = "1"`
#      - `"1"` is not in `s`, so add `"1"` to `s`.
#    - Column 4: `item = board[1][4] = "9"`
#      - `"9"` is not in `s`, so add `"9"` to `s`.
#    - Column 5: `item = board[1][5] = "5"`
#      - `"5"` is not in `s`, so add `"5"` to `s`.

# 4. **Row 2**:
#    - Column 3: `item = board[2][3] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 4: `item = board[2][4] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 5: `item = board[2][5] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# - **End of Second Sub-Grid Check**:
#   - All items are unique, so move to the next 3x3 sub-grid.

# ---

# #### **Third 3x3 Sub-Grid (Top-Right Corner)**

# - **Starting Point**: `(0,6)`

# The grid cells for this sub-grid are as follows:

# ```plaintext
# . . .
# . . .
# . 6 .
# ```

# - **Execution Steps**:

# 1. **Initialize `s = set()`.

# 2. **Row 0**:
#    - Column 6: `item = board[0][6] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 7: `item = board[0][7] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 8: `item = board[0][8] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# 3. **Row 1**:
#    - Column 6: `item = board[1][6] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 7: `item = board[1][7] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 8: `item = board[1][8] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# 4. **Row 2**:
#    - Column 6: `item = board[2][6] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.
#    - Column 7: `item = board[2][7] = "6"`
#      - `"6"` is not in `s`, so add `"6"` to `s`.
#    - Column 8: `item = board[2][8] = "."`
#      - `item` is `"."`, so ignore and move on.

# - **End of Third Sub-Grid Check**:
#   - All items are unique.

# ---

# ### Continuing with Remaining Sub-Grids

# The code repeats these steps for each of the remaining 3x3 sub-grids, validating that all numbers are unique within each sub-grid. 

# After iterating over all sub-grids and confirming that no duplicates were found, the code prints `"True"` at the end, meaning the board meets the Sudoku 3x3 sub-grid rule.
