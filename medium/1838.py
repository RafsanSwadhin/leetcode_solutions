# explanation:

# The condition `while total_operations + k < nums[right] * (right - left + 1):` ensures that we have enough operations (increments) to make all elements in the current window equal to `nums[right]`. Let's break it down in detail.

# ### Understanding the Logic

# The goal of the function is to maximize the frequency of any element after making increments. To do that, we can think of making a subarray where all elements are equal to the value `nums[right]` â€” the current rightmost element in our window. This is possible only if we have enough increments (i.e., operations).

# Let's look at each part of the condition:

# - **`total_operations`**: This is the sum of all elements within the current window, from `left` to `right`.
# - **`k`**: This is the maximum number of increments we can perform overall.
# - **`nums[right] * (right - left + 1)`**: This is the ideal sum we want for the current window if every element were equal to `nums[right]`.

# ### The Condition in Context

# For all elements in the current window to become equal to `nums[right]`, the sum of these elements would need to be `nums[right] * (right - left + 1)`. This is because if every element in the window were `nums[right]`, the sum of the window would be `nums[right]` multiplied by the number of elements in the window, `(right - left + 1)`.

# Thus, the condition:

# ```python
# while total_operations + k < nums[right] * (right - left + 1):
# ```

# checks if the sum of the current elements in the window (`total_operations`) plus the allowed increments (`k`) is still less than this ideal sum (`nums[right] * (right - left + 1)`). 

# - **If the condition is `True`**, we can't make all elements in the current window equal to `nums[right]` even with the given `k` operations, so we need to shrink the window by moving `left` to the right.
  
# - **If the condition is `False`**, it means that with `k` increments, we can indeed make all elements in the window equal to `nums[right]`. So, we proceed without adjusting `left`.

# ### Example

# Let's use a simplified example with `nums = [1, 2, 4]` and `k = 5`:

# 1. **Right Pointer at `nums[2] = 4`**:
#    - `total_operations = 7` (sum of `[1, 2, 4]`)
#    - Window size is `3` (`right - left + 1 = 2 - 0 + 1`)
#    - Ideal target sum: `nums[right] * (right - left + 1) = 4 * 3 = 12`
#    - Condition check: `total_operations + k < nums[right] * (right - left + 1)` becomes `7 + 5 < 12`, which is `False`.

# Since the condition is `False`, we know we can make all elements in `[1, 2, 4]` equal to `4` using `k` increments, achieving a frequency of 3.
