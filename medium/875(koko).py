    def canFinish(k):
        hours = 0
        for pile in piles:
            # Calculate the hours needed for each pile
            hours += (pile + k - 1) // k  # This is equivalent to math.ceil(pile / k)

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canFinish(mid):
            right = mid  # Try a smaller k
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Increase k
            
    return left

# Example usage
print(minEatingSpeed([3, 6, 7, 11], 8))  # Output: 4
print(minEatingSpeed([30, 11, 23, 4, 20], 5))  # Output: 30
print(minEatingSpeed([30, 11, 23, 4, 20], 6))  # Output: 23

# Sure! Let's go through the example `print(minEatingSpeed([3, 6, 7, 11], 8))` step by step, explaining each part of the code.

# ### Step-by-Step Explanation

# 1. **Function Call**: 
#    ```python
#    print(minEatingSpeed([3, 6, 7, 11], 8))  # Output: 4
#    ```
#    - This line calls the `minEatingSpeed` function with the piles of bananas `[3, 6, 7, 11]` and the time limit of `8` hours.
   
# ### Inside the `minEatingSpeed` Function

# 2. **Defining the `canFinish` Function**:
#    ```python
#    def canFinish(k):
#    ```
#    - This defines a helper function `canFinish(k)` that will determine if Koko can finish all the bananas at a speed of \( k \) bananas per hour.

# 3. **Initializing Binary Search**:
#    ```python
#    left, right = 1, max(piles)
#    ```
#    - Here, `left` is initialized to `1` (the minimum eating speed), and `right` is set to `max(piles)`, which is `11` in this case. This sets up the range for our binary search.

# 4. **Binary Search Loop**:
#    ```python
#    while left < right:
#    ```
#    - This loop will continue until `left` is no longer less than `right`. The goal is to narrow down the possible values for \( k \).

# ### First Iteration of Binary Search

# 5. **Calculating Midpoint**:
#    ```python
#    mid = (left + right) // 2
#    ```
#    - In the first iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(1 + 11) // 2`, which is `6`.

# 6. **Calling `canFinish`**:
#    ```python
#    if canFinish(mid):
#    ```
#    - Now, the function checks if Koko can finish all the bananas at a speed of `6`.

# ### Inside the `canFinish` Function (for k = 6)

# 7. **Initialize Hours Counter**:
#    ```python
#    hours = 0
#    ```
#    - A variable `hours` is initialized to `0`. This will keep track of the total hours Koko takes to eat all the bananas.

# 8. **Loop Through Each Pile**:
#    ```python
#    for pile in piles:
#    ```
#    - This loop goes through each pile in `[3, 6, 7, 11]`.

# 9. **Calculating Hours for Each Pile**:
#    - For the **first pile** (`3`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (pile + k - 1) // k  # (3 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 0
#      ```
#      - Calculation: \( (3 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 0 \) hours (since she can finish this pile in less than an hour).
#      - `hours` remains `0`.

#    - For the **second pile** (`6`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (6 + 6 - 1) // 6  # (6 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 1
#      ```
#      - Calculation: \( (6 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 1 \) hour.
#      - `hours` is now `1`.

#    - For the **third pile** (`7`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (7 + 6 - 1) // 6  # (7 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 1
#      ```
#      - Calculation: \( (7 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 1 \) hour.
#      - `hours` is now `2`.

#    - For the **fourth pile** (`11`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (11 + 6 - 1) // 6  # (11 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 2
#      ```
#      - Calculation: \( (11 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 2 \) hours.
#      - `hours` is now `4`.

# 10. **Check Total Hours**:
#     ```python
#     return hours <= h  # 4 <= 8
#     ```
#     - Finally, it checks if the total hours (`4`) is less than or equal to the available hours (`8`). Since this is **True**, `canFinish(6)` returns **True**.

# ### Back to the Binary Search

# 11. **Adjusting Search Range**:
#     ```python
#     right = mid  # right = 6
#     ```
#     - Since Koko can finish at speed `6`, we try a smaller speed. So, `right` is updated to `6`.

# ### Second Iteration of Binary Search

# 12. **Calculating Midpoint Again**:
#     ```python
#     mid = (left + right) // 2  # mid = (1 + 6) // 2 = 3
#     ```

# 13. **Calling `canFinish` for k = 3**:
#     ```python
#     if canFinish(mid):
#     ```

# ### Inside the `canFinish` Function (for k = 3)

# 14. **Resetting Hours Counter**:
#     ```python
#     hours = 0
#     ```

# 15. **Loop Through Each Pile**:
#    - For the **first pile** (`3`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (3 + 3 - 1) // 3  # 1
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `1`.

#    - For the **second pile** (`6`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (6 + 3 - 1) // 3  # 2
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `3`.

#    - For the **third pile** (`7`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (7 + 3 - 1) // 3  # 3
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `6`.

#    - For the **fourth pile** (`11`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (11 + 3 - 1) // 3  # 4
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `10`.

# 16. **Check Total Hours**:
#     ```python
#     return hours <= h  # 10 <= 8
#     ```
#     - This time, the total hours (`10`) exceeds the available hours (`8`), so `canFinish(3)` returns **False**.

# ### Back to the Binary Search

# 17. **Adjusting Search Range Again**:
#     ```python
#     left = mid + 1  # left = 4
#     ```
#     - Since Koko cannot finish at speed `3`, we need to increase \( k \), so `left` is updated to `4`.

# ### Third Iteration of Binary Search

# 18. **Calculating Midpoint Again**:
#     ```python
#     mid = (left + right) // 2  # mid = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5
#     ```

# 19. **Calling `canFinish` for k = 5**:
#     ```python
#     if canFinish(mid):
#     ```

# ### Inside the `canFinish` Function (for k = 5)

# 20. **Resetting Hours Counter**:
#     ```python
#     hours = 0
#     ```

# 21. **Loop Through Each Pile**:
#    - For the **first pile** (`3`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (3 + 5 - 1) // 5  # 1
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `1`.

#    - For the **second pile** (`6`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (6 + 5 - 1) // 5  # 2
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `3`.

#    - For the **third pile** (`7`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (7 + 5 - 1) // 5  # 2
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `5`.

#    - For the **fourth pile** (`11`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (11 + 5 - 1) // 5  # 3
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `8`.

# 22. **Check Total Hours**:
#     ```python
#     return hours <= h  # 8 <= 8
#     ```
#     - The total hours (`8`) is equal to the available hours (`8`), so `canFinish(5)` returns **True**.

# ### Back to the Binary Search

# 23. **Adjusting Search Range Again**:
#     ```python
#     right = mid  # right = 5
#     ```

# ### Fourth Iteration of Binary Search

# 24. **Calculating Midpoint Again**:
#     ```python
#     mid = (left + right) // 2  # mid = (4 + 5) // 2 = 4
#     ```

# 25. **Calling `canFinish` for k = 4**:
#     ```python
#     if canFinish(mid):
#     ```

# ### Inside the `canFinish` Function (for k = 4)

# 26. **Resetting Hours Counter**:
#     ```python
#     hours = 0
#     ```

# 27. **Loop Through Each Pile**:
#    - For the **first pile** (`3`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (3 + 4 - 1) // 4  #

#  1
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `1`.

#    - For the **second pile** (`6`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (6 + 4 - 1) // 4  # 2
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `3`.

#    - For the **third pile** (`7`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (7 + 4 - 1) // 4  # 2
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `5`.

#    - For the **fourth pile** (`11`):
#      ```python
#      hours += (11 + 4 - 1) // 4  # 3
#      ```
#      - `hours` becomes `8`.

# 28. **Check Total Hours**:
#     ```python
#     return hours <= h  # 8 <= 8
#     ```
#     - The total hours (`8`) is equal to the available hours (`8`), so `canFinish(4)` returns **True**.

# ### Back to the Binary Search

# 29. **Final Adjustment**:
#     ```python
#     right = mid  # right = 4
#     ```

# ### Exit the Loop

# 30. **Loop Condition Check**:
#     ```python
#     while left < right:
#     ```
#     - Now, `left` and `right` are both `4`, so the loop ends.

# ### Final Result

# 31. **Return the Minimum Speed**:
#     ```python
#     return left  # return 4
#     ```
#     - The function returns `4`, which is the minimum eating speed \( k \) that allows Koko to finish all the bananas in the given time.

# 32. **Print Output**:
#     - The `print` statement outputs `4`, which is the expected result.

# ### Summary
# In summary, the function uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all the bananas within the given time limit by checking various speeds and adjusting the search range accordingly. The steps above provide a detailed walkthrough of how the algorithm processes the input and arrives at the result.
