Let's break down the given code that generates Pascal's triangle row by row, step by step. This is for the **Pascal's triangle problem** where `s = 4` means the triangle should have 4 rows.

### Pascal's Triangle Basics:
In Pascal's Triangle:
- The first and last element of each row is always `1`.
- Every other element in a row is the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.

For example, for 4 rows:
```
  1        (row 0)
 1 1       (row 1)
1 2 1      (row 2)
1 3 3 1    (row 3)
```

Now, letâ€™s walk through the code:

### Initial Setup:

```python
s = 4
res = [[1]]  # Initialize the result list with the first row [1]
```

- `s = 4` means we want 4 rows of Pascal's triangle.
- `res = [[1]]` initializes the Pascal's triangle with the first row `[1]`, because the first row in Pascal's triangle is always `[1]`.

### Main Loop:

```python
for i in range(s-1):
```

- This loop runs `s-1` times because we already have the first row, and we need to generate `s-1` additional rows (in this case, `4-1 = 3` rows).
- Each iteration will generate a new row for the triangle.

### Step 1: Prepare Temporary List `temp`

```python
temp = [0] + res[-1] + [0]
```

- `res[-1]` refers to the **last row** of `res` (i.e., the most recently generated row).
- `temp = [0] + res[-1] + [0]` surrounds the last row with zeros on both sides. This padding helps when calculating the new row's elements by summing pairs of adjacent elements in the previous row.
  
Example:
- After the first row `res = [[1]]`, `res[-1] = [1]`. So, `temp = [0, 1, 0]`.
- After the second row `res = [[1], [1, 1]]`, `res[-1] = [1, 1]`. So, `temp = [0, 1, 1, 0]`.

### Step 2: Generate the New Row

```python
row = []  # Initialize an empty list for the new row
for j in range(len(res[-1]) + 1):
    row.append(temp[j] + temp[j+1])
```

- This loop goes through the `temp` list and sums each pair of adjacent elements from `temp`, then appends the result to `row`.
- `temp[j] + temp[j+1]` calculates the sum of adjacent elements.

Example:
- For `temp = [0, 1, 0]` (from the first iteration), the loop will run for `len(res[-1])+1 = 2` times:
  - `j = 0`: `row.append(temp[0] + temp[1]) => row.append(0 + 1) => row = [1]`
  - `j = 1`: `row.append(temp[1] + temp[2]) => row.append(1 + 0) => row = [1, 1]`

  So, the new row becomes `[1, 1]`.

- For `temp = [0, 1, 1, 0]` (from the second iteration), the loop will run for `3` times:
  - `j = 0`: `row.append(temp[0] + temp[1]) => row.append(0 + 1) => row = [1]`
  - `j = 1`: `row.append(temp[1] + temp[2]) => row.append(1 + 1) => row = [1, 2]`
  - `j = 2`: `row.append(temp[2] + temp[3]) => row.append(1 + 0) => row = [1, 2, 1]`

  So, the new row becomes `[1, 2, 1]`.

### Step 3: Add the New Row to the Result

```python
res.append(row)
```

- The newly generated row (`row`) is added to the list `res`.

### Final Output:

After running the loop, the result `res` will contain 4 rows of Pascal's triangle.

```python
print(res)
```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initial state**:
   - `res = [[1]]`

2. **Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)**:
   - `temp = [0, 1, 0]`
   - Generate `row = [1, 1]` by summing adjacent elements of `temp`.
   - Append `row` to `res`: `res = [[1], [1, 1]]`

3. **Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)**:
   - `temp = [0, 1, 1, 0]`
   - Generate `row = [1, 2, 1]` by summing adjacent elements of `temp`.
   - Append `row` to `res`: `res = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`

4. **Iteration 3 (`i = 2`)**:
   - `temp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`
   - Generate `row = [1, 3, 3, 1]` by summing adjacent elements of `temp`.
   - Append `row` to `res`: `res = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]`

### Final `res`:
```
[
 [1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 3, 1]
]
```

### Conclusion:
The code generates Pascal's triangle row by row. It starts with `[1]` and uses each previous row to generate the next row by adding adjacent elements padded with zeros. This process is repeated until the desired number of rows (`s = 4`) is generated.
