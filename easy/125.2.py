In the provided code, the line `while l < r and s[l].isalnum() == False:` is used to skip non-alphanumeric characters while moving from the left end of the string (`l`) towards the right end. Let's break down what this line does:

1. `while l < r`: This is the outer loop that ensures the left pointer `l` is always to the left of the right pointer `r`. It continues as long as `l` is less than `r`, meaning there are still characters to compare.

2. `s[l].isalnum() == False:`: This part checks if the character at position `l` in the string `s` is not alphanumeric. The `isalnum()` method returns `True` if the character is an alphabet letter or a digit, and `False` otherwise.

3. `l += 1`: If the character at `s[l]` is not alphanumeric, it increments the left pointer `l` to move to the next character in the string. This continues until `l` points to an alphanumeric character or until `l` becomes greater than or equal to `r`.

The purpose of this loop is to skip over any non-alphanumeric characters from the left end of the string while ensuring that `l` doesn't surpass `r`. This is done to focus on the alphanumeric characters for the palindrome comparison, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters.
