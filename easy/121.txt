In the provided code, the line second_value += 1 is placed outside of the if-else block because it is meant to increment the second_value index regardless of whether the condition in the if statement is satisfied or not. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality step by step:

Initialize first_value and second_value to 0 and 1, respectively.

Initialize max_profit to 0.

Enter a while loop that continues as long as second_value is less than the length of the prices list.

Within the loop:

Check if the price at prices[second_value] is greater than the price at prices[first_value]. If this condition is satisfied, it means there's a potential profit.
If the condition is met, calculate the profit as the difference between the prices at second_value and first_value.
Update max_profit to the maximum of the current profit and the previous max_profit.
If the condition is not satisfied, it means the price at second_value is not greater than the price at first_value, indicating a potential new starting point for calculating future profits. Therefore, update first_value to second_value.
Regardless of whether the condition is satisfied or not, increment second_value to move on to the next index.
After the while loop completes, the max_profit will hold the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price within the given list of prices.

The placement of second_value += 1 outside the if-else block ensures that, in either case (whether a profit can be obtained or not), the second_value index is incremented, and the loop continues to process the next price in the prices list. This ensures that the algorithm correctly evaluates all possible profit scenarios for buying and selling stocks based on the given prices.
